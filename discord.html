    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>To run this on the regular Discord client its as simple as pressing <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>Shift</code> + <code>I</code> and pasting it into the console.</p>
    <p><i>Sure there's a big "HOLD IT!" warning, but you're not stupid right? You can read JavaScript, right? You're not a baka... R-right?</i></p>
    <p>This wont persist when you restart Discord or if you're on browser when you refresh the page. Instead of having to paste it in every time you can press <code>Up</code> in the console to bring up the last command.</p>
    <p>For desktop client I recommend making a snippet in the debugger. Navigate to <b>Sources</b>, then next to the <b>Page</b> and <b>Filesystem</b> headers in the top right, select <b>Snippets</b> in the dropdown. Right click the sidebar to create a new snippet, paste the code, save it and press <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>Enter</code> to run it. This way you can easily edit the chances and not clutter up your console.</p>
    <h2>Disabling it</h2>
    <p>Why on earth would you want to do that?!</p>
    <p>In the console, paste <code>observer.disconnect()</code>. Or simply refresh the page (on the desktop client this can be done with <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>R</code>).</p>
    <p>Or if you're a bit dense and on the desktop client you can restart the entire thing. Better yet, restart your whole PC.</p>
