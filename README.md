OwO'ify browser extension and Discord script

## Discord

### Desktop Discord client

To run this on the regular discord client its as simple as pressing `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I` and pasting it into the console.

*Sure there's a big "HOLD IT!" warning, but you're not stupid right? You can read JavaScript, right? You're not a baka... R-right?*

This wont persist when you restart Discord or if you're on browser when you refresh the page.
Instead of having to paste it in every time you can press `Up` in the console to bring up the last command.

For desktop client I reccoment making a snippet in the debugger.
Navigate to **Sources**, then next to the **Page** and **Filesystem** headers in the top right, select **Snippets** in the dropdown.
Right click the sidebar to create a new snippet, paste the code, save it and press `Ctrl` + `Enter` to run it.
This way you can easily edit the chances and not clutter up your console.
