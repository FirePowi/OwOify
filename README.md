Examples of changes:

`Hello friends, how is everyone?` -> `*waises paw* h-hewwo friends h-how is evewyone? (*≧▽≦)`

`Hey I am going to the supermarket, do you want anything?` -> `*giggles* H-hey I am g-going to the supewmawket, do you want a-anything? (・ω・)`

`This is why god has abandoned us` -> `*blushes* T-This is why gosh has abandonyed  u-us (´,,•ω•,,)♡`

## Discord

### Desktop Discord client

#### Usage

To run this on the regular Discord client its as simple as pressing `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I` and pasting it into the console.

*Sure there's a big "HOLD IT!" warning, but you're not stupid right? You can read JavaScript, right? You're not a baka... R-right?*

This wont persist when you restart Discord or if you're on browser when you refresh the page.
Instead of having to paste it in every time you can press `Up` in the console to bring up the last command.

For desktop client I reccoment making a snippet in the debugger.
Navigate to **Sources**, then next to the **Page** and **Filesystem** headers in the top right, select **Snippets** in the dropdown.
Right click the sidebar to create a new snippet, paste the code, save it and press `Ctrl` + `Enter` to run it.
This way you can easily edit the chances and not clutter up your console.

#### Disabling it

Why on earth would you want to do that?!

In the console, paste `observer.disconnect()`.
Or simply refresh the page (on the desktop client this can be done with `Ctrl` + `R`).

Or if you're a bit dense and on the desktop client you can restart the entire thing.
Better yet, restart your whole PC.
